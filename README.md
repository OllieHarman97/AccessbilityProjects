# AccessbilityProjects
These are the projects that I completed during my course on Accessibility in Web Design and Development.

## How to use these extensions

First download the Extensions that you want to try out.
Then go to the [Chrome Extensions Manager](chrome://password-manager/passwords) and add the code into it.
From there you can go to the [Designated Website](https://sarahmorrisonsmith.com/) where this works, which is the website of my Accessbile Design Professor!
Then hopefully the extension will load up and you can see what projects I've done!

## What each of the Projects do

### Project 1

This is a speech extension that reads out the div that is being moused over once space bar is held down.

### Project 2

This is a magnifier that magnifies the div that is being moused over once Spacebar is pressed.

### Project 3

This is a mouse replacement option that can be used by pressing space and then matching up the red lines to whatever you want to click on!
